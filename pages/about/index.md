The photographs offered in this portfolio are hand printed by myself and limited to an edition of 250-300 images. They were made with a variety of medium and large format cameras exclusively on negative film, both color and black & white. Having worked at this for some twenty years it seems to me that specific brand names of equipment don't matter much; I'm not much of a camera buff. I believe strongly in three principles: 1) The old adage "F8 and be there", which means don't burden yourself with vast amounts of technique and equipment. Get out there and make pictures. 2) A photographer's most important tool is a very large trash can, and 3) Avoid looking for the next market; photograph what you care about.

The photographs are mounted and matted with archival materials (mattes are double, white ragboard) and are guaranteed. Please return within 30 days for a refund if for any reason you aren't pleased.

All photographs in this portfolio are copyright of Alan Klug.
