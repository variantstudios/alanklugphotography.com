If there is a steady current in these images, I believe it is this: it is a search for a quiet alternative to the noise and hustle of modern living. Television, radio, social media, constant chatter. There is much to be revealed in silence, for lack of distraction, for concentration on a “lucid stillness” at the center, all essential for the creation of philosophy, painting, or poetry, and, I think, for the art of photography. The images have been variously described as “serene,” “reserved,” “quietly elegant.”

I have been making darkroom photographs for over thirty years, but now, because darkroom materials are disappearing from the market, and because of some few health issues connected with constant exposure to chemicals, I have transitioned into archival pigment ink printing of my negatives onto fine art papers. This type of printing is capable of producing archival images of the highest museum quality and longevity. Many of my images, in fact, look better to me than their gelatin silver predecessors.

Prints are limited to an edition of 250. Print-only prints are printed with a white border and signed, numbered and titled on the border. The rest are mounted and double matted white with archival materials, signed and titled on the matte, numbered verso. Our frame is a simple, medium dark wood 1 ¼” wide with regular picture glass. There is no extra charge for shipping in the lower 48 states.
